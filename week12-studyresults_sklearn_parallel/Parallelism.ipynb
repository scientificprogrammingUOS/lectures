    "Python is a hard langauge to make multithreaded, mostly because of the **global interpreter lock**: Python is an interpreted language, and if the interpreter runs in only one thread, all the nice threads you're producing also run in only one thread.  \n",
    "While multi*processing* finds a way around that, even multithreading can still be of use. While multithreading can, in Python, not be **parallel**, it can still be **concurrent**. \n",
    "* *parallel* processes run truly at the same time - meaning that they must run sumultaneously on different CPU-cores\n",
